<p class="one"> Matty Roberts, also known as video game streamer SmyleeKun, created the event on Facebook on June 27 as a joke, unaware of the viral attention the event would receive.The event plans for the raid in Amargosa Valley from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. PDT on September 20, 2019. The Facebook event writes, "If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets [sic] see them aliens", referring to the unique running style of anime character Naruto Uzumaki and several other characters, who run with their arms stretched behind them, head down and torso tilted forward. Roberts said the event had only around 40 signatures three days into the event's listing and then suddenly went viral. The meme possibly spread first on the app TikTok, as well as Reddit and Instagram later. The Facebook page for the event is filled with thousands of satirical posts discussing the best way to break into Area 51. After the viral spread of the meme, Roberts was worried that he would receive a visit from the FBI. The event received 2 million "Going" and another 1.5 million "Interested" signatures as of August 22. Roberts has since made plans to organize a music festival based on the event known as "Alienstock". Rapper Lil Nas X released a music video for the Young Thug and Mason Ramsey remix of "Old Town Road" about the planned raid.

	Copycat events such as plans to storm a genealogical vault of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Loch Ness, and the Bermuda Triangle have also been created. In the Netherlands, a left-wing meme page known as "Memes for the Masses" created "Storm the Education Implementation Office Headquarters" event as a protest to student loans.</p>

<p class="three">
	As of September 23, 2019, due to low number of participants at Area 51 and no actual raid of the facility occurring, and the high concentration of participants of the Alienstock festival events, the name of the Facebook event page created by Roberts was changed to "Official Alienstock Tour" and it was planned to take place on September 18â€“20, 2020. </p>
