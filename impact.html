<p class="one"> In August 2019, Lincoln County officials drafted an emergency declaration and a plan to pool resources with neighboring counties, anticipating the region being overwhelmed by a crowd of 40,000 people.The county has just 184 hotel rooms, and officials expected the local cellphone network to be unable to cope with the additional traffic; they also expressed concerns about overcrowding at campsites, gas stations, and public medical facilities.[38] Both planned music festivals were granted permits by the county. County sheriff Kerry Lee said an extra 300 paramedics and 150 police officers would be brought in from across Nevada. </p>

<p class="two">The town of Rachel posted a caution on its website, advising attendees to be "experienced in camping, hiking and surviving in a harsh desert environment and have a vehicle in good shape". They advised that the town would likely be unable to provide sufficient food, water or gas to visitors, and expected local law enforcement to be "overwhelmed". The website warned that local residents would be ready to "step up to protect their property", adding that "[i]t will get ugly" and predicting that Alienstock would be "Fyre Festival 2.0". </p>

<p class="three"> Business owners in and around Rachel, Nevada, a town of just 56 people just outside of the base, made preparations for visitors who want to go to Area 51. Connie West, co-owner of the Little A'Le'Inn restaurant and inn, had all 13 rooms of the inn booked and planned to open up 30 acres for camping and said she might create merchandise for the event. Las Vegas businessman George Harris was planning to hire bands to play at an annual festival called "The Swarm". Kosmic Kae, owner of the shop Aliens R Us in Boulder City, said that even though the shop is 170 miles away from Area 51, business had increased due to fascination regarding aliens. </p>

<p class="four"> In Lincoln County, Nevada, two music festivals were also planned: Alienstock in Rachel, and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in Hiko, Nevada. However, local governments and police feared that even these legal events might be problematic if too many people showed up. In July, Matty Roberts first expressed interest in a music festival to be made outside Area 51, in what would eventually become Alienstock. In mid-September, Roberts announced on his website that Alienstock was canceled due to poor planning, concerns of safety and legality, and lack of infrastructure, adding that he feared a "possible humanitarian disaster";he also said the event would be relocated to Las Vegas in reduced form and renamed Area 51 Celebration. However, Little A'Le'Inn owner Connie West said the original Alienstock plans would proceed, adding in an interview that "there's nothing I can do to stop it". Roberts' lawyers sent her a cease and desist letter regarding the use of the "Alienstock" name.</p>

<p class="five">Other businesses around the U.S. based products and services on this event. A collection of merchandise related to the event from online retailers was launched. Bud Light planned to release a promotional alien-themed beer label and promised a free beer to "any alien that makes it out" as long as a tweet with the new design gets 51,000 retweets.[47][48][49][50] Fast food restaurant Arby's had planned to deliver food with a special menu to the event.
After the event Keith Wright, a promoter for the Area 51 Basecamp event said that they had taken a gamble and lost. However Connie West, who organized Alienstock declared her event a success on Sunday. </p>
