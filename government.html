<p class="one"> On July 10, speaking with The Washington Post, Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews said officials were aware of the event, and issued a warning saying: "[Area 51] is an open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces", adding that "[t]he U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets". A public information officer at Nellis Air Force Base told KNPR that "any attempt to illegally access the area is highly discouraged". A viral Reddit post showed what it claimed to be an (unclassified, "as a joke") Air Force briefing on the Naruto run. The FBI also stated that they would be monitoring the situation and "the [number of people] that may be coming to these events". </p>

<p class="two">The events surrounding the storm prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to post two temporary flight restrictions, closing the airspace above two places nearby Area 51 during the days surrounding the planned raid. </p>

<p class="three">The Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), the military's public relations office, made a controversial tweet implying the use of bomber aircraft on trespassers. The tweet has since been deleted, and the DVIDS also tweeted an apology. </p>
